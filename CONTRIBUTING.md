# Development Setup Guide for Erlang Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to the Erlang Repository! ðŸŽ‰

This guide aims to assist contributors in setting up their local development environment. Feel free to suggest improvements or raise questions in your contributions.

## Pre-requisites

To work with this repository, you'll need the following tools and dependencies:

- **Erlang/OTP Version** :
  
- We support the latest major release plus the prior two releases, aligning with Ericssonâ€™s version support policy for Erlang itself.  
- For a definitive list of supported versions, refer to the [erlang.yml](.github/workflows/erlang.yml) file in this repository.  

If using the Elixir API:  

* Elixir 1.14+

* For a definitive list of supported versions, refer to the [elixir.yml](.github/workflows/elixir.yml) file in this repository.

* Refer to the official [Erlang Installation Guide](https://www.erlang.org/downloads) for setting up Erlang.

## Local Run/Build

### Setting Up and Running the Project Locally

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Start required services:

```
docker compose up -d
```

Set up Erlang/OTP and Rebar3 and Verify setup (Ensure you have the correct versions as specified in the prerequisites):

Run the compilation step to check for errors:
```
rebar3 compile
```

## Testing

To execute tests, use the following commands:

### Unit Tests (EUnit):

```
rebar3 eunit
```

### Integration and Functional Tests (Common Test):

```
rebar3 ct
```

### Test results and logs can be viewed in a browser by opening:

```
build/test/logs/index.html

```
### Elixir Tests

Elixir tests are run in two places:

1. Inside apps/opentelemetry_api/:

```
mix test
```

2. At the top level:

```
mix test --no-start test/otel_tests.exs test/otel_metric_tests.exs
```

## Contribution Rules
Please review the [OpenTelemetry Specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/) for details on coding standards, commit message formatting, and the contribution process.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Debugging Common Failures

* Test Failures: Check the test logs in _build/test/logs/.

* Compilation Issues: Ensure correct OTP and Rebar3 versions are installed.

* Dialyzer Warnings: Ensure rebar3 compile completes successfully.

## Developer Setup and Language Servers

For improved development experience, consider using the following Language Server Protocols (LSPs):

* Erlang LSP: [Erlang Language Platform](https://whatsapp.github.io/erlang-language-platform/)

* Installing it removes the need for an additional type-checking step:

```
elp eqwalize-all
```

* Install from: [Erlang Language Platform Releases](https://github.com/WhatsApp/erlang-language-platform/releases/)

* Elixir LSP: [Elixir LS](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls)
